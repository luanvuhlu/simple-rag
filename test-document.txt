This is a test document for the RAG application.

The document contains information about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms
that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Natural language processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that deals with
the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to
understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic
meaning and relationships between words and phrases. They are essential for
building effective retrieval-augmented generation systems.
